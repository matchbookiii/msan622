## Discussion ##

I created a simulation to compare three bus scheduling algorithms.  I want the visualizations presented here to be able to convince the viewer which algorithm is best.

The data consists of 30 iterations for each algorithm.  Each iteration is a random sample of passenger demand based upon passengers "going home" from work. For each iteration, each algorithm is applied to the same sample so that the comparison is fair.
