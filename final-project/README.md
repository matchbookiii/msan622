## Overview and Goals ##
I wrote a simulation that simulated three bus scheduling algorithms.  I want the below visualizations to be able to guide the viewer to conclusively evaluate which of the algorithms is the best.  I also want the viewer to develop a "feel" for how how each algorithm functions.  Finally, I want to be able to verify the accuracy of the simulation visually.

The simulation consisted of 30 bus passenger demand profiles that were simulated by each of the three scheduling algorithms. For each of the 30 simulations, there was a "bus file," that recorded the position of the bus and its arrival time to its next destination for each time period, and there was a "people file," that recorded the born, board, and arrival times as well as the origin and destination locations of each passenger.  For the visualizations below, these original files were transformed into the following files: (1) "pChart.csv" is the passenger file for the first iteration only.  (2) "pChartBig.csv" which is the same as (1) except for all 30 iterations. (3) "pfix.csv" which is time-by-time list of all passengers waiting for a bus for each bus. (4) "busfix.csv" is a time-by-time accounting of the position of each bus.

## Raw Data Explorations ##
For the raw data visualizations, the data is in the file "pChart.csv".  This file is a summary
